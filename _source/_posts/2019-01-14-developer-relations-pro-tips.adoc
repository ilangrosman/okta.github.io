I've been a professional developer advocate for a little over two years. I started out at Stormpath, and six months later, I lept at the opportunity to do the same thing at Okta. I say "professional" because even though I've been a technical speaker since 2004, I never got paid for it.

During my first year (2017) at Okta, I traveled and spoke a lot. __A lot__ being more than I'd ever traveled and spoke previously. By my count, I spoke 37 times, at 20 conferences, in 10 different countries. Near the end of that year, I experienced a bit of burnout. From that experience, and from talking to friends, I realized that I was trying to hard. I was creating too many new presentations for conferences. A couple team members experienced travel fatigue as well, so we decided to refocus in early 2017.

Now we focus on producing content on developer.okta.com and our YouTube channel first and foremost, and we try to speak at an event once per month. If that event happens to be local, great! We have no hard and fast rules on where you should speak, but we do recommend you hit major US cities, and target meetups (because they're more intimate).

Recently, I tweeted a "DevRel Pro Tip" about how we produce content here at Okta.

I'm not sure if it was the content of that tweet, or the excellent image created by https://twitter.com/reverentgeek[David Neal], but its my most popular tweet. Ever!

Because of the positive feedback from that tweet, I figured it'd be fun to talk to friends that do developer relations to get their pro tips for making life easier. Of course, these tips don't just apply to developer advocates, they apply to pretty much anyone that blogs and speaks (for fun or profit).
